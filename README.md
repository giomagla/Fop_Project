# Simple Python Interpreter
___
### Overview
This capstone project implements a simple interpreter for a minimalistic programming language using Java. The interpreter focuses on supporting basic programming constructs such as:

 - Variables: Define and manipulate data.
 - Arithmetic Operations: Perform basic mathematical computations.
 - Conditionals: Execute conditional logic (e.g., if, else).
 - Iterative Control Flow: Implement loops for repeated execution of code blocks.

The interpreter demonstrates its functionality by executing simple algorithms and showcases its effectiveness as a learning and demonstration tool.
